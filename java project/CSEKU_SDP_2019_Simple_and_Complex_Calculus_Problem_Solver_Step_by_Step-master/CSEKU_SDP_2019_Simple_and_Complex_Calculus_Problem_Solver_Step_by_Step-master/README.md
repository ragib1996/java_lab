Project Description: Our project goal was to develop a software that can solve differentiation and integration of  simple and complex calculus problems. But we cannot reach our goal fully. We  only develop our logic to solve differentiation of it's profound formulas. Here we need to put differential function(y=f(x)) as input and output (dy/dx) is  the solution shown step by step. We use java language for this project. To make the solution, we  have faced challenge to generate various types of logic according to various differential patterns. We have created classes and declared methods that are responsible to perform a certain task. These classes and methods are interrelated and interconnected to manipulate and process data.
